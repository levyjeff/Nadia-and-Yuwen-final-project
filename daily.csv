Under this strategy, a <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/sites/covid/health-orders/201112_Stay%20at%20home%20advisory%20and%20guidance_vF.pdf" target="_blank">Stay-at-Home Advisory</a> went into effect on November 16. Though not ordered to do so, Chicago residents are strongly advised to remain in their homes except when traveling to work or school or when seeking out essential needs such as medical care, going to the grocery store or pharmacy, picking up food, or receiving deliveries. Those who must leave their homes are advised to wear a face covering and practice social distancing. Further, residents are strongly advised to:</p>

	<li>Not have guests in their homes unless they are essential workers (e.g., home healthcare providers, childcare workers or educators)</li>
	<li>Cancel traditional Thanksgiving celebrations</li>
	<li>Avoid travel</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications under the second round of the <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/dceo/SmallBizAssistance/Pages/C19DisadvantagedBusGrants.aspx" target="_blank">Business Interruption Grants Program</a> (BIG), developed by Governor Pritzker and the Illinois General Assembly, will open on Thursday, September 17. The program aims to provide funding to small business and especially those businesses in disproportionately impacted areas and heavily impacted industries. The $220 million available under the second round has been allocated in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Heavily Impacted Industries
	<ul>
		<li>$60 million for heavily distressed industries, such as movie theatres, performing arts venues, concert venues, indoor recreation, amusement parks, and more.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Disproportionately Impacted Areas (DIA)
	<ul>
		<li>$70 million set aside for DIAs, defined by zip codes identified by the General Assembly for communities that are most economically distressed and vulnerable to COVID-19. A searchable map of DIAs can be found <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/dceo/SmallBizAssistance/Pages/C19DisadvantagedBusGrants.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Downstate Communities
	<ul>
		<li>The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) has committed to ensuring that at least half of all remaining funds, totaling more than $100 million, are reserved for businesses in downstate and rural communities of Illinois.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Priority Businesses
	<ul>
		<li>Apart from the $60 million for heavily impacted industries, applications from the following types of businesses will be prioritized for review for remaining funds: businesses directly affected by regional mitigations implemented by the state or local governments, independently owned retail, tourism and hospitality related industries including accommodations, and more.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Agriculture
	<ul>
		<li>$5 million of the remainder of funds will be set aside for livestock production disruptions. Applications will be available in the coming weeks from the Illinois Department of Agriculture.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Grants and Loan Forgiveness for Illinois Small Business Emergency Loan recipients
	<ul>
		<li>As authorized by the General Assembly, DCEO will offer grants for businesses that have incurred eligible costs to offset loans received under the Illinois Small Business Emergency Loan program. This round of loan forgiveness and grants will go to businesses that have received loans or remain on the wait list and the program will sunset going forward as DCEO and its partners focus on making BIG awards.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Businesses outside the above categories are eligible to apply for and receive funding but may be reviewed later than priority businesses. While the application portal is not open until September 17, the DCEO has released the application <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/dceo/SmallBizAssistance/Documents/BIG Round 2 Application 091620.pdf" target="_blank">questions</a> and required document <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/dceo/SmallBizAssistance/Documents/BIG%20Round%202%20Required%20Documents%20091520.pdf" target="_blank">checklist</a>.</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules do not apply to individuals and penalties will not exceed a misdemeanor and a $75-$2,500 fine.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Governor signed <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=101-0651" target="_blank">Senate Bill 471</a>, that will take effect immediately, to help protect workers who continue to serve on the frontlines of the pandemic. The law adds a penalty for assaulting or battering a retail worker who is conveying public health guidance. The law also increases paid disability leave for any injury that occurs after March 9, 2020 by 60 days for firefighters, law enforcement and paramedics whose recovery was hindered by COVID-19.</p>

<p>More specifically, eligible employees include:</p>

<ul>

Now, Illinois is divided into the following regions: North, North-Central, West-Central, Metro East, Southern, East-Central, Southern Suburban, West Suburban, North Suburban, Suburban Cook, and Chicago.</p>

<p>In light of the recent COVID-19 resurgence in Illinois, each region could be subject to additional restrictions based upon the following factors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sustained increase in 7-day rolling average (7 out of 10 days) in the positivity rate; and one of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Sustained 7-day increase in hospital admissions for a COVID-19 like illness; or</li>
		<li>Reduction in hospital capacity threatening surge capabilities (ICU capacity or medical/surgical beds under 20%)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Or, three consecutive days averaging greater than or equal to 8% positivity rate</li>
</ul>

<p>If an individual region experiences a resurgence, as defined by the factors above, it may be subject to various mitigation tiers. Continued resurgence will cause a region to advance to a more restrictive mitigation tier. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Offices
	<ul>
		<li>Tier 1: Institute remote work for high risk individuals; continued emphasis on telework for as many workers as possible</li>
		<li>Tier 2: Reduce office capacity with recommendations to resume remote work where possible</li>
		<li>Tier 3: Institute remote work for all non-essential workers</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>*Phase 3 guidelines</p>

<p>While guidelines differ between industries, common guidelines include (1) maintaining 6-foot social distancing, (2) requiring face coverings in common areas, (3) frequently cleaning &ldquo;high touch&rdquo; areas, and (4) posting visual signage regarding hygiene, social distancing and proper PPE. Importantly, these industry guidelines do not provide a one-size-fits-all blueprint. Rather, businesses should take care to assess employee and customer needs as well as the layout and dimensions of the business facility.</p>

<p><strong>(Chicago):</strong> Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2020/6/12/21289631/illinois-chicago-reopening-coronavirus-pritzker-cases-deaths-june-12" target="_blank">announced</a> that Chicago is on track to move into the next phase of reopening on July 1.

At this time, Illinois will assumedly move into Phase 4 of Governor Pritzker&rsquo;s plan on June 26, with Chicago entering Phase 4 of Governor Pritzker&rsquo;s and Mayor Lightfoot&rsquo;s respective plans on July 1.</p>

<p><strong>June 11, 2020:</strong></p>

<p>Governor Pritzker <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2020/06/10/pritzker-says-illinois-on-track-move-phase-4" target="_blank">announced</a> that while Illinois is on track to move into Phase 4 of his <a href="https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069t000000BadS0AAJ?operationContext=S1" target="_blank">Restore Illinois Plan</a> it will not do so before June 26. The following factors will determine whether Illinois will move into Phase 4:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cases and Capacity: </strong>The determination of moving from Phase 3 to Phase 4 will be driven by the COVID-19 positivity rate in each region and measures of maintaining regional hospital surge capacity.

	<ul>
		<li>At or under a 20 percent positivity rate and increasing no more than 10 percentage points over a 14-day period, AND</li>
		<li>No overall increase (i.e. stability or decrease) in hospital admissions for COVID-19-like illness for 28 days, AND</li>
		<li>Available surge capacity of at least 14 percent of ICU beds, medical and surgical beds, and ventilators</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Testing:</strong> Testing available in region regardless of symptoms or risk factors</li>
	<li><strong>Tracing: </strong>Begin contact tracing and monitoring within 24 hours of diagnosis for more than 90% of cases in region</li>
</ul>

<p>Illinois&rsquo; progression into Phase 4 will bring the following changes:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gatherings: </strong>Gatherings of 50 people or fewer are allowed with this limit subject to change based on latest data and guidance</li>
	<li><strong>Travel: </strong>Travel should follow IDPH and CDC approved guidance</li>
	<li><strong>Health care:</strong> All health care providers are open</li>
	<li><strong>Education and child care: </strong>P-12 schools, higher education, all summer programs, and child care open with IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
	<li><strong>Outdoor Recreation: </strong>All outdoor recreation allowed</li>
	<li><strong>Businesses:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> All manufacturing open with IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
		<li>&ldquo;<strong>Non-essential&rdquo; businesses:</strong> All employees return to work with IDPH approved safety guidance; Employers are encouraged to provide accommodations for COVID-19-vulnerable employees</li>
		<li><strong>Bars and restaurants:</strong> Open with capacity limits and IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
		<li><strong>Personal care services and health clubs:</strong> All barbershops, salons, spas and health and fitness clubs open with capacity limits and IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
		<li><strong>Entertainment: </strong>Cinema and theaters open with capacity limits and IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
		<li><strong>Retail:</strong> Open with capacity limits and IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>May 26, 2020:</strong></p>

<p>As Illinois prepares to move into Phase 3 of Governor Pritzker&rsquo;s <a href="https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069t000000BadS0AAJ?operationContext=S1" target="_blank">Restore Illinois Plan</a> on May 29, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity has released a <a href="https://dceocovid19resources.com/assets/Restore-Illinois/businesstoolkits/all.pdf" target="_blank">Phase 3 Business Toolkit</a>.

<p><strong>(Chicago):</strong> Mayor Lightfoot has <a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/government/lightfoot-lays-out-next-phase-reopening-plan" target="_blank">announced</a> that Chicago is not yet on track to move into Phase 3 of Governor Pritzker&rsquo;s Plan with the rest of Illinois. Mayor Lightfoot previously released her own <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2020/May/ReopeningFramework.pdf" target="_blank">Plan</a> to reopen Chicago which includes more restrictive language than Governor Pritzker&rsquo;s broader Plan for Illinois. While Illinois is set to move into Phase 3 of Governor Pritzker&rsquo;s Plan on May 29, Chicago will stay behind with the hope of moving into Phase 3 of Mayor Lightfoot&rsquo;s plan in mid-June. Phase 3 of Mayor Lightfoot&rsquo;s plan currently includes the following:</p>

<p>Phase Three: Cautiously Reopen &ndash; Strict physical distancing with some businesses opening; goal is to thoughtfully begin to reopen Chicago safely</p>

<ul>
	<li>Non-essential workers begin to return to work in a phased way</li>
	<li>Select businesses, non-profits, city entities open with demonstrated, appropriate protections for workers and customers</li>
	<li>When meeting others, physically distance and wear a face covering</li>
	<li>Non-business, social gatherings limited to &lt;10 persons</li>
	<li>Phased, limited public amenities begin to open</li>
	<li>Stay at home if you feel ill or have come into contact with someone with COVID-19</li>
	<li>Continue to physically distance from vulnerable populations</li>
	<li>Get tested if you have symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>Under Mayor Lightfoot&rsquo;s Plan the following specific epidemiological factors have been established to guide Chicago from Phase 2 to Phase 3:</p>

<ul>
	<li>COVID-19 Case Rate (over 14 days, as a rolling average):
	<ul>
		<li>Declining rate of new cases, based on incidence and/or percent positivity</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Severe Outcome Rate (over 14 days, as a rolling average):
	<ul>
		<li>Stable or declining rates of cases resulting in hospitalization, ICU admission, and/or death</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Hospital Capacity Citywide (over 14 days, as a rolling average):
	<ul>
		<li>Hospital beds: &lt;1800 COVID patients</li>
		<li>ICU beds: &lt;600 COVID patients</li>
		<li>Ventilators: &lt;450 COVID patients</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Testing Capacity:
	<ul>
		<li>Test at least 5% of Chicago residents per month</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Testing Percent Positivity Rates (over 14 days, as a rolling average):
	<ul>
		<li>Congregate: &lt;30% positive tests</li>
		<li>Community: &lt;15% positive tests</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Syndromic Surveillance (over 14 days, as a rolling average):
	<ul>
		<li>Declining emergency department visits for influenza-like illness and/or COVID-like illness</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Case Investigation &amp; Contract Tracing:
	<ul>
		<li>Expanded system in place for congregate and community investigations and contact tracing</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>May 21, 2020:</strong></p>

<p>A proposed emergency rule from Governor Pritzker which would make it a Class A misdemeanor for businesses to open in violation of Illinois&rsquo; Stay At Home Order has <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/coronavirus/pritzker-withdraws-emergency-rule-to-enforce-stay-at-home-order/2275422/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> been withdrawn.</p>

<p><strong>May 19, 2020:</strong></p>

<p>Under Governor Pritzker&rsquo;s 5-Phase Restore Illinois <a href="https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069t000000BadS0AAJ?operationContext=S1" target="_blank">plan</a>, Illinois is broken up into the following four regions: Northeast Illinois; North-Central Illinois; Central Illinois; and Southern Illinois. Notably, the Northeast Illinois region includes highly populated counties such as Cook, DuPage and Lake. Illinois is currently positioned in phase 2 of the plan and individual regions will progress into phase 3 based on the following factors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>At or under a 20 percent positivity rate and increasing no more than 10 percentage points over a 14-day period, AND</li>
	<li>No overall increase (i.e. stability or decrease) in hospital admissions for COVID-19-like illness for 28 days, AND</li>
	<li>Available surge capacity of at least 14 percent of ICU beds, medical and surgical beds, and ventilators</li>
</ul>

<p>In early May, Northeast Illinois was the only region to not meet the above factors. Specifically, Northeast Illinois failed to have a positivity rate at or under 20 percent. However, the Illinois Department of Public Health now <a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/restore" target="_blank">reports</a> a positivity rate in the Northeast Illinois region of 17.5%. Northeast Illinois <a href="https://www.kcchronicle.com/2020/05/17/covid-19-update-all-four-regions-regions-remain-on-track-for-phase-3-of-restore-illinois-plan/auv0n20/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> dropped below a 20 percent positivity rate on May 14. As such, the region is on track to join Illinois&rsquo; other three regions in moving into phase 3 on May 29. Phase 3 of the plan includes the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><u>Gatherings</u>: All gatherings of 10 people or fewer are allowed with this limit subject to change based on latest data &amp; guidance</li>
	<li><u>Travel</u>: Travel should follow IDPH and CDC approved guidance</li>
	<li><u>Health Care</u>: All health care providers are open with DPH approved safety guidance</li>
	<li><u>Education and child care</u>: Remote learning in P-12 schools and higher education; Limited child care and summer programs open with IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
	<li><u>Outdoor recreation</u>: State parks open; Activities permitted in groups of 10 or fewer with social distancing</li>
	<li><u>Businesses</u>:
	<ul>
		<li><u>Manufacturing</u>: Non-essential manufacturing that can safely operate with social distancing can reopen with IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
		<li><u>&ldquo;Non-essential&rdquo; businesses</u>: Employees of &ldquo;non-essential&rdquo; businesses are allowed to return to work with IDPH approved safety guidance depending upon risk level, tele-work strongly encouraged wherever possible; Employers are encouraged to provide accommodations for COVID-19-vulnerable employees</li>
		<li><u>Bars and restaurants</u>: Open for delivery, pickup, and drive through only</li>
		<li><u>Personal care services and health clubs</u>: Barbershops and salons open with IDPH approved safety guidance; Health and fitness clubs can provide outdoor classes and one-on-one personal training with IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
		<li><u>Retail</u>: Open with capacity limits and IDPH approved safety guidance, including face coverings</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>May 18, 2020:</strong></p>

<p>Governor Pritzker filed new <a href="https://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/COVID19/77-690RG-E.pdf" target="_blank">emergency rules</a> which would allow businesses that open in violation of his Stay At Home <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-32.aspx" target="_blank">Order</a> to be charged with a Class A misdemeanor. The rules will <a href="https://wgem.com/2020/05/17/illinois-businesses-that-defy-stay-at-home-order-could-face-misdemeanor-charges/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> be reviewed by a bipartisan oversight committee of legislators on Wednesday, May 20. The rules, if not rejected by the committee, will remain in place for 150 days.</p>

<p><strong>May 13, 2020:</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Madison County):</strong> Madison County passed a 4-Phase <a href="https://cms4.revize.com/revize/madisoncounty/document_center/County%20News%20Home/MADCO%20Reopen%20Guidelines%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">Order</a> to re-open. The first phase lasts from May 13 through May 27 and includes the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Nonessential travel may resume</li>
	<li>Avoid social gatherings of 10 or more people</li>
	<li>Retail business may open with a 25% occupancy</li>
	<li>Restaurants/Bars may continue to prepare and serve food for off-premise consumption while serving through means such as in-house delivery, third-party delivery, drive-through service and curbside pick-up. Additionally, patrons may use seated dining at a rate of 25% occupancy</li>
	<li>Personal Care Providers (such as hair, nail, massage, etc.) may reopen. When possible limit customers by appointment only</li>
	<li>Professional Services (such as banking, accounting) may reopen. When possible limit customers by appointment only</li>
	<li>While the Madison County Board of Health recognizes the constitutional limitation we have to regulate attendance and religious freedom, churches and other places of worship may open with a 50% occupancy</li>
	<li>Childcare facilities may reopen. All food preparation surfaces, handles, knobs and common surfaces shall be sanitized before and after each use. Continual cleaning of surfaces used by employees and children is encouraged</li>
	<li>Gyms, exercise facilities and other indoor recreation spaces may reopen at 25% occupancy. Equipment should be maintained according to local health department guidelines</li>
	<li>Public parks, golf courses, campgrounds, athletic fields, swimming pools and other outdoor recreation spaces may reopen. Distancing between family members is at their discretion. Golf carts can have an occupancy of two people or more if designed for extra passengers. It is suggested that one bring sanitizing wipes for common items (items open to use by all visitors such as playground equipment). The bleacher section must follow social distancing guidelines. Personal seating may be used, but social distancing guidelines must be maintained</li>
	<li>Theatres, museums and bowling alleys may reopen at 25% occupancy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Illinois Statewide <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-32.aspx" target="_blank">Order</a> remains in place until the end of May. This County Order conflicts with Governor Pritzker&rsquo;s <a href="https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069t000000BadS0AAJ?operationContext=S1" target="_blank">re-opening plan</a> and the state order may supersede the County Order.</p>

<p><strong>May 11, 2020:</strong></p>

<p>Governor Pritzker announced where each of Illinois&rsquo; four regions stand in relation to his <a href="https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069t000000BadS0AAJ?operationContext=S1" target="_blank">5-phase</a> Restore Illinois plan. The four regions under this plan include: Northeast Illinois; North-Central Illinois; Central Illinois; and Southern Illinois. All regions are currently positioned in Phase 2 and the factors determining a region&rsquo;s progression into Phase 3 are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>At or under a 20 percent positivity rate and increasing no more than 10 percentage points over a 14-day period, AND</li>
	<li>No overall increase (i.e. stability or decrease) in hospital admissions for COVID-19-like illness for 28 days, AND</li>
	<li>Available surge capacity of at least 14 percent of ICU beds, medical and surgical beds, and ventilators</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, all Illinois regions, with the exception of Northeast Illinois, are on track to move into Phase 3 at the end of May. At this point, Northeast Illinois fails under the first factor, concerning positivity rate. Notably, the Northeast Illinois region includes densely populated counties such as Cook, Will, DuPage and Lake, among others. However, Governor Pritzker emphasized that this positivity metric is based on a 14-day period and, as such, Northeast Illinois may still satisfy this requirement and progress into Phase 3 with Illinois&rsquo; other three regions.</p>

<p><strong>May 8, 2020:</strong></p>

<p><strong>(City of Chicago): </strong>Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2020/May/ReopeningFramework.pdf" target="_blank">five phase framework</a> for reopening Chicago titled &ldquo;Protecting Chicago.&rdquo; This Chicago specific framework runs in conjunction with Governor Pritzker&rsquo;s <a href="https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069t000000BadS0AAJ?operationContext=S1" target="_blank">Restore Illinois</a> plan. Mayor Lightfoot <a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/05/08/mayor-lightfoot-protecting-chicago-framework-5-phase-gradual-reopening/" target="_blank">stated</a> that Chicago has experienced Phase 1 and is now in Phase 2. Under this framework, Chicago&rsquo;s progression into Phase 3 would include the following:</p>

<p>Phase Three: Cautiously Reopen - Strict physical distancing with some businesses opening; goal is to thoughtfully begin to reopen Chicago safely</p>

<ul>
	<li>Non-essential workers begin to return to work in a phased way</li>
	<li>Select businesses, non-profits, city entities open with demonstrated, appropriate protections for workers and customers</li>
	<li>When meeting others, physically distance and wear a face covering</li>
	<li>Non-business, social gatherings limited to</li>
</ul>

<p>Under this framework, advancement through the phases is based upon epidemiological criteria rooted in public health guidance that will be reviewed and revisited on an ongoing basis. The following specific epidemiological factors have been established to guide Chicago from Phase 2 to Phase 3:</p>

<ul>
	<li>COVID-19 Case Rate (over 14 days, as a rolling average):
	<ul>
		<li>Declining rate of new cases, based on incidence and/or percent positivity</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Severe Outcome Rate (over 14 days, as a rolling average):
	<ul>
		<li>Stable or declining rates of cases resulting in hospitalization, ICU admission, and/or death</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Hospital Capacity Citywide (over 14 days, as a rolling average):
	<ul>
		<li>Hospital beds: &lt;1800 COVID patients</li>
		<li>ICU beds: &lt;600 COVID patients</li>
		<li>Ventilators: &lt;450 COVID patients</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Testing Capacity:
	<ul>
		<li>Test at least 5% of Chicago residents per month</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Testing Percent Positivity Rates (over 14 days, as a rolling average):
	<ul>
		<li>Congregate: &lt;30% positive tests</li>
		<li>Community: &lt;15% positive tests</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Syndromic Surveillance (over 14 days, as a rolling average):

<p>Governor Pritzker announced a <a href="https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/sfc/servlet.shepherd/document/download/069t000000BadS0AAJ?operationContext=S1" target="_blank">5-Phase plan</a> to &ldquo;Restore Illinois.&rdquo; Illinois will move through the phases regionally based on the following four regions: Northeast Illinois; North-Central Illinois; Central Illinois; and Southern Illinois. Notably, the Northeast Illinois region includes densely populated counties such as Cook, Will, DuPage and Lake, among others. Governor Pritzker noted that Illinois has already experienced Phase 1 of the plan and is now positioned in Phase 2. Movement from Phase 2 to Phase 3 will be driven by the COVID-19 positivity rate in each region and measures of maintaining regional hospital surge capacity. Data relevant to this includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>At or under a 20 percent positivity rate and increasing no more than 10 percentage points over a 14-day period, AND</li>
	<li>No overall increase (i.e. stability or decrease) in hospital admissions for COVID-19-like illness for 28 days, AND</li>
	<li>Available surge capacity of at least 14 percent of ICU beds, medical and surgical beds, and ventilators</li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 3 includes the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><u>Gatherings</u>: All gatherings of 10 people or fewer are allowed with this limit subject to change based on latest data &amp; guidance</li>
	<li><u>Travel</u>: Travel should follow IDPH and CDC approved guidance</li>
	<li><u>Health Care</u>: All health care providers are open with DPH approved safety guidance</li>
	<li><u>Education and child care</u>: Remote learning in P-12 schools and higher education; Limited child care and summer programs open with IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
	<li><u>Outdoor recreation</u>: State parks open; Activities permitted in groups of 10 or fewer with social distancing</li>
	<li><u>Businesses</u>:
	<ul>
		<li><u>Manufacturing</u>: Non-essential manufacturing that can safely operate with social distancing can reopen with IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
		<li><u>&ldquo;Non-essential&rdquo; businesses</u>: Employees of &ldquo;non-essential&rdquo; businesses are allowed to return to work with IDPH approved safety guidance depending upon risk level, tele-work strongly encouraged wherever possible; Employers are encouraged to provide accommodations for COVID-19-vulnerable employees</li>
		<li><u>Bars and restaurants</u>: Open for delivery, pickup, and drive through only</li>
		<li><u>Personal care services and health clubs</u>: Barbershops and salons open with IDPH approved safety guidance; Health and fitness clubs can provide outdoor classes and one-on-one personal training with IDPH approved safety guidance</li>
		<li><u>Retail</u>: Open with capacity limits and IDPH approved safety guidance, including face coverings</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Linear movement through the phases is not guaranteed and, following IDPH recommendation, regions may be moved back into a previous phase. The factors which may cause a regression include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sustained rise in positivity rate</li>
	<li>Sustained increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 like illness</li>
	<li>Reduction in hospital capacity threatening surge capabilities</li>
	<li>Significant outbreak in the region that threatens the health of the region</li>
</ul>

<p>May 5, 2020: Governor Pritzker announced a 5-Phase &ldquo;Restore Illinois&rdquo; plan today. The plan will be instituted regionally based on the following four regions: Northeast Illinois; North-Central Illinois; Central Illinois; and Southern Illinois. Governor Pritzker explained that Illinois already experienced Phase 1 and, since the modified Stay At Home <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-32.aspx" target="_blank">Order</a> was instituted on May 1, has been positioned in Phase 2. While no official document for Restore Illinois has been released the Phases are <a href="https://wrex.com/2020/05/05/pritzker-announces-5-phase-reopen-illinois-plan/" target="_blank">reportedly</a> as follows:</p>

<p><u>Phase 1 &ndash; Rapid Spread</u>: The rate of infection among those tested and the number of patients admitted to the hospital is high or rapidly increasing. Strict stay at home and social distancing guidelines are put in place and only essential businesses remain open. Every region has experienced this phase once already and could return to it if mitigation efforts are unsuccessful.</p>

<p><u>Phase 2 &ndash; Flattening</u>: The rate of infection among those tested and the number of patients admitted to the hospital beds and ICU beds increases at an ever slower rate, moving toward a flat and even a downward trajectory. Non-essential retail stores reopen for curb-side pickup and delivery. Illinoisans are directed to wear a face covering when outside the home, and can begin enjoying additional outdoor activities like golf, boating and fishing while practicing social distancing. To varying degrees, every region is experiencing flattening as of early May.</p>

<p><u>Phase 3 &ndash; Recovery</u>: The rate of infection among those tested, the number of patients admitted to the hospital, and the number of patients needing ICU beds is stable or declining. Manufacturing, offices, retail, barbershops and salons can reopen to the public with capacity and other limits and safety precautions. All gatherings limited to 10 or fewer people are allowed. Face coverings and social distancing are the norm. The earliest a region can move to this phase is May 29.</p>

<p><u>Phase 4 &ndash; Revitalization</u>: The rate of infection among those tested and the number of patients admitted to the hospital continues to decline. All gatherings of up to 50 people are allowed, restaurants and bars reopen, travel resumes, child care and schools reopen under guidance from the IDPH. Face coverings and social distancing are the norm.</p>

<p><u>Phase 5 &ndash; Illinois Restored</u>: With a vaccine or highly effective treatment widely available or the elimination of any new cases over a sustained period, the economy fully reopens with safety precautions continuing. Conventions, festivals and large events are permitted, and all businesses, schools, and places of recreation can open with new safety guidance and procedures in place reflecting the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Governor Pritzker emphasized that there is no guarantee of a linear progression through these phases.</p>

Employees working in the store must follow the social Distancing Requirements, and must wear a face covering when they may come within six feet of another employee or a customer.</li>
	<li><strong>Requirements for manufacturers</strong>. Manufacturers that continue to operate pursuant to this Order must follow Social Distancing Requirements and take appropriate precautions, which may include:
	<ul>

		<li>staggering shifts;</li>
		<li>reducing line speeds;</li>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Requirements for all businesses</strong>. All businesses must evaluate which employees are able to work from home, and are encouraged to facilitate remote work from home when possible. All businesses that have employees physically reporting to a work-site must post the guidance from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and Office of the Illinois Attorney General regarding workplace safety during the COVID-19 emergency. The guidance will be posted on the IDPH webpage.</li>
